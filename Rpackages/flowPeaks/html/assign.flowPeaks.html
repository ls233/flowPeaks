<h2>Obtain the flowPeaks cluster lables with the option of identifying
outliers and applying to a new data set</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The function takes a flowPeaks output and a new data set
(or could be the same dataset that generated the flowPeaks), and
compute the cluster label assignment</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
assign.flowPeaks(fp,A,tol=0.01,fc=0.8)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>


<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>fp</code></td>
<td>
<p>an object of class flowPeaks, the output from the function
<code><a href="flowPeaks.html">flowPeaks</a></code> or  <code><a href="adjust.flowPeaks.html">adjust.flowPeaks</a></code></p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>A</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data matrix with the same number of columns as the data
that geneterated fp</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>tol</code></td>
<td>
<p>All points where the probability
density is less than tol (default is
1%) of the peak
denisty of that cluster are labled as outliers. If tol is set
0, no outliers according to this rule. The details can be seen in
the first equation of Section 2.5 in
the flowPeaks manuscript (Ge et al 2012)</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>fc</code></td>
<td>
<p>All points  where the classified cluster
contributes less than fc (default is 80%)
of overall denstiy  are labeled as
outliers. if fc is set to 0%, no outliers can be found
according to this rule. The details can be seen in the second
equation of
Section 2.5 in
the flowPeaks manuscript (Ge et al 2012)</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Value</h3>


<p>It returns the class label assignment of each data point, where -1
indicates outliers. When A is the same data that generated fp,
If tol is 1 and fc is 0, the returned
labels are the same as fp$peaks.cluster.
